# Comprehensive Requirements for a Modern Spreadsheet Application

## 1. Core Functionality

### Grid System
- The application must provide a two-dimensional grid with uniquely identifiable cells using alphanumeric coordinates (e.g., A1, B2, Z100)
- Support for a minimum of 1,000 rows and 100 columns in a single sheet
- Multiple worksheets/tabs within a single document, with a minimum of 10 sheets supported
- Ability to navigate between cells using keyboard (arrow keys, Tab, Enter) and mouse
- Proper cell selection mechanisms: single cell, row/column, and range selections
- Support for non-contiguous selections using Ctrl/Cmd key

### Data Entry
- Direct editing of cell contents with immediate visual feedback
- Support for text, numbers, dates, and formulas
- Formula entry must be prefixed with an equals sign (=)
- Data validation options for controlling what can be entered into cells
- Auto-completion suggestions for formulas and functions

### Performance Requirements
- Initial load time under 3 seconds on standard hardware
- Cell rendering and calculation updates must complete within 100ms for visible cells
- Smooth scrolling performance with at least 30fps when navigating large datasets
- Support for at least 100,000 cells with data without significant performance degradation
- Memory management to handle large spreadsheets without browser crashes

## 2. Formula Support

### Basic Functions
- Mathematical operators: +, -, *, /, ^, % (modulo)
- Comparison operators: =, <, >, <=, >=, <>
- Logical operators: AND, OR, NOT
- Cell referencing (A1, B2) and range referencing (A1:B5)

### Function Categories
- Statistical functions: SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MIN, MAX, MEDIAN, STDEV
- Logical functions: IF, AND, OR, NOT, TRUE, FALSE
- Text functions: CONCATENATE, LEFT, RIGHT, MID, LEN, TRIM, UPPER, LOWER
- Date/time functions: NOW, TODAY, DATE, YEAR, MONTH, DAY
- Lookup functions: VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH
- Financial functions: PMT, RATE, NPV, IRR, FV

### Formula Behavior
- Cell dependency tracking for proper recalculation chains
- Circular reference detection and handling
- Error types: #DIV/0!, #VALUE!, #REF!, #NAME?, #NUM!, #N/A
- Formula evaluation caching for performance optimization
- Support for relative vs. absolute cell references ($A$1, $A1, A$1)

## 3. Formatting and Styling

### Cell Formatting
- Font properties: family, size, weight, style, color
- Text alignment: horizontal (left, center, right) and vertical (top, middle, bottom)
- Text wrapping and overflow options
- Number formats: general, number, currency, date, percentage, scientific, fraction
- Custom number formats with placeholders and conditions
- Conditional formatting based on cell values or formulas

### Visual Elements
- Borders: style, width, and color for each cell edge
- Background colors and patterns
- Merged cells spanning multiple rows/columns
- Row height and column width adjustment
- Header row/column freezing for better navigation
- Cell comments and notes

## 4. Data Management

### Organization
- Row and column insertion, deletion, and reordering
- Sorting capabilities (ascending, descending) by single or multiple columns
- Filtering data based on values or conditions
- Grouping rows/columns for collapsible sections
- Search and replace functionality across sheets

### Import/Export
- Import from and export to common formats: CSV, TSV, Excel formats (XLSX, XLS)
- Copy/paste support, including from external applications
- Export to PDF for printing or sharing
- Preservation of formatting during import/export operations
- Batch import/export capabilities

## 5. User Interface

### Visual Design
- Clean, intuitive interface with familiar spreadsheet conventions
- Consistent styling and iconography
- Light and dark theme support
- Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- Context-sensitive menus based on selection state

### Navigation and Interaction
- Formula bar for viewing and editing cell contents
- Status bar showing selected range, calculation results, zoom level
- Toolbar with common actions and formatting options
- Context menus for quick access to relevant operations
- Keyboard shortcuts matching industry standards (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, etc.)
- Zoom in/out capabilities for better visibility
- Undo/redo with at least 50 steps of history

## 6. Error Handling and Edge Cases

### Resilience
- Recovery from calculation errors without crashing
- Graceful degradation when encountering resource limitations
- Auto-save functionality to prevent data loss
- Handling of extremely large numbers and text strings
- Support for international characters and localization

### Edge Cases
- Empty cells must be handled consistently in calculations
- Proper treatment of zero values vs. empty cells
- Handling of text that appears numeric and vice versa
- Date and time zone handling across different locales
- Proper error messages for invalid operations

## 7. Advanced Features

### Data Analysis
- Pivot tables for data summarization
- Charts and graphs: bar, line, pie, scatter, area, etc.
- Data visualization options with customizable appearance
- Sparklines for inline mini-charts
- What-if analysis tools (Goal Seek, Scenario Manager)

### Extensibility
- API for custom formula functions
- Plugin/extension system for additional functionality
- Integration with external data sources
- Automation and macro capabilities
- Custom toolbar and menu options

## 8. Accessibility and Usability

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation for all operations
